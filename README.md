# Civilization VI Enhanced Adjacency Bonus UI

A Civilization VI mod that enhances the district placement interface by displaying reverse adjacency bonuses - showing the benefits that the new district would provide to existing districts in your city.

## üéØ What This Mod Does

When placing a district in Civilization VI, the game normally shows you the adjacency bonuses that the new district would receive from surrounding tiles. This mod **adds** information about the reverse adjacency bonuses - the benefits your new district would provide to existing districts.

### Before vs After
- **Before**: See only "+2 Gold from River" when placing a Commercial Hub
- **After**: See "+2 Gold from River, +9 Faith" - now including the reverse bonus

## ‚ú® Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Uses the existing adjacency bonus display system
- **Native Styling**: Matches the game's visual style perfectly
- **All Districts**: Works with every district type
- **Edge Case Handling**: Functions whether or not base adjacency bonuses exist
- **Tooltip Support**: Enhanced tooltips with detailed information
- **Mock Data**: Demonstrates +9 Faith bonus (easily replaceable with real calculations)

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Download**: Clone or download this repository
2. **Install**: Copy the `ReverseAdjacencyMod` folder to your Civilization VI mods directory:
   - **Windows**: `Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Mods\`
   - **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Mods/`
   - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/aspyr-media/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Mods/`
3. **Enable**: Launch Civilization VI and enable the mod in Additional Content
4. **Play**: Start a new game and try placing districts!

## üîß How It Works

### Technical Implementation
- **File Replacement**: Uses `ReplaceUIScript` to replace `DistrictPlotIconManager.lua`
- **Function Hooking**: Intercepts `GetAdjacentYieldBonusString` function
- **Bonus Injection**: Appends reverse adjacency data to existing bonus display
- **Format**: Uses native game formatting: `[ICON_Faith][COLOR:ResFaithLabelCS]+9[ENDCOLOR]`

### Code Structure
```
ReverseAdjacencyMod/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ReverseAdjacencyMod.modinfo                           # Mod metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ReverseAdjacencyConfig.lua                        # Mock bonus configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UI/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DistrictPlotIconManager_ReverseAdjacency.lua      # Main implementation
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

The mock bonus can be easily customized in `Data/ReverseAdjacencyConfig.lua`:

```lua
local MOCK_REVERSE_BONUS = {
    YieldType = "YIELD_FAITH",    -- Change yield type
    Amount = 9,                   -- Change bonus amount
    Icon = "ICON_Faith",          -- Change display icon
    ColorStyle = "ResFaithLabelCS" -- Change text color
};
```

## üî¨ Development Process

This project demonstrates a systematic approach to Civilization VI modding:

1. **Research Phase**: Analyzed successful existing mods for proven patterns
2. **Discovery Phase**: Found actual game systems through file analysis  
3. **Implementation Phase**: Built solution using established techniques
4. **Testing Phase**: Validated functionality in-game
5. **Documentation Phase**: Created comprehensive documentation

See the `/tasks/` folder for detailed development documentation.

- **[Development Tasks](tasks/)** - Detailed task tracking and implementation process
- **[Modding Knowledge Base](CIV6_MODDING_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md)** - General Civ 6 modding reference
- **[AI Instructions](AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Development guidelines used during creation

## üéØ Future Enhancement

This mod uses mock data (+9 Faith) to demonstrate the enhancement technique. The structure is designed to easily integrate with actual reverse adjacency calculation logic:

1. Replace `GetMockReverseAdjacencyBonus()` function
2. Add real calculation logic for district-to-district bonuses
3. Customize bonus amounts based on actual game rules

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This mod serves as a proof-of-concept for UI enhancement techniques. Possible improvements:

- Real reverse adjacency calculations
- Different yield types based on district interactions
- Conditional display based on technologies/civics
- Multiplayer compatibility testing

## üìÑ License

This project is open source. The mod is designed for educational and enhancement purposes for Civilization VI.
